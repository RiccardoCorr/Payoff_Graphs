# Payoff Graphs Visualizer

This project provides an interactive visualizer for option payoffs. Users can explore different options strategies (like Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, and Short Put) and observe how the profit/loss varies depending on the underlying asset's price. The visualizer is designed to help you better understand the mechanics of options and how various factors like strike price, premium, and underlying price affect the payoff.
